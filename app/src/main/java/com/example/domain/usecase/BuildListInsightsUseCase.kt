 *    count, which on a large account puts "Planning" above "Watching" - and the
 *    one number that changes week to week ends up below a hundred static ones.
 *  - Formats: by count, so the biggest is at the top.
 *  - Scores: ascending by score. A score chart that is ordered by *frequency*
 *    interleaves 100 between 60 and 90 and stops being a scale.
 *  - Years: ascending by year. Same reason, and it makes "which years am I behind
 *    on" a glance rather than a hunt.
