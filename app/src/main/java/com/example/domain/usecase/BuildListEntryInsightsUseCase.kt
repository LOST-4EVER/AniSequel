/**
 * The Stats tab's three charts that AniList's aggregate statistics do not cover.
 *
 * `User.stats` answers status, format, score, genre, tag and year - and has
 * nothing at all for country, episode count or the year a thing was *watched*
 * rather than released. Those three come from the media list the app already
 * downloads whole for the sequel walk, which is why they cost no request.
 *
 * ## Why this is a use case and not a `groupBy` in the ViewModel
 *
 * Because the bucket boundaries are decisions. "7-16 episodes" is not a fact
 * about AniList; it is a choice about which shows a 12-episode cour counts as,
 * and it is the kind of choice that has to be written down, argued about and
 * pinned by a test rather than buried in a `when` next to a coroutine.
