/**
 * The bundled release notes.
 *
 * ## Why this is a test and not a convention
 *
 * `assets/changelog.json` exists so the app's "What's new" card and the release
 * page can never disagree — one file, several readers. That only works if the
 * file is actually correct, and a release workflow reads it without any of this
 * repo's tests running. Three ways it went wrong before, all invisible in review:
 *
 *  - **No notes at all.** The file is hand-edited; a version whose notes nobody
 *    wrote renders an empty card in the app and a release page that falls back to
 *    a generic description. That is what `update.json`'s `notes` actually said,
 *    because it was copied from the release body rather than from this file.
 *  - **A duplicated or out-of-order version.** The file is hand-edited and
 *    prepend-only, so the newest entry drifting to the bottom is easy.
 *  - **Malformed JSON.** Hand-edited JSON is a syntax error away, and the reader
 *    deliberately swallows parse errors so the Settings screen cannot crash. That
 *    safety net is exactly what would hide a broken file from a release build.

     * It started out that way, and it cannot work. The release workflow does not
     * use the version in `gradle.properties`: the resolver step advances the patch
     * number past whatever the newest published release is, so a repo sitting at
     * 1.0.23 with v1.0.28 already published releases as 1.0.29. No file can
     * contain that number before the build runs, so a test pinning
     * `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` was pinning a number CI invents.
     *
     * Every consumer therefore reads the newest block, and this asserts that
     * block has notes in it. `latestWithNotes` returning null is what an empty
     * What's new card looks like.
