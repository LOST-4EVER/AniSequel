/**
 * Guards the profile screen's activity grid.
 *
 * The layout is the thing worth pinning, because a heatmap can look entirely
 * plausible while being laid out a week off, and the two mistakes below are the
 * ones a screenshot review does not catch:
 *
 *  - **Weekday rows are Sunday-first.** The gutter prints M, W and F. If the
 *    grid were built Monday-first those letters would land on Tuesday, Thursday
 *    and Saturday, and the whole grid would be shifted by one row.
 *  - **The last column is the week containing today.** Anchoring on "today's
 *    week" rather than on "today minus N weeks" is what makes the newest cell
 *    today; anchoring on a rolling day count makes the right edge a Sunday
 *    somewhere in the future and every grid looks a week stale.
