/**
 * Guards the shape tokens that outline every tab bar and segmented control.
 *
 * Both of these used to be `RoundedPolygon`s drawn through `toShape()`, and that
 * is what produced the eggs and blobs in the released UI: a `RoundedPolygon` is
 * authored on a *square* perimeter, and `toShape()` maps that square onto
 * whatever `Size` the layout hands it, scaling x and y independently. On a tab
 * measured 120x44, `MaterialShapes.Pill` came out as a 120x44 ellipse rather
 * than a capsule, and `pillSoft` - which pointed at `Cookie7Sided`, a
 * seven-sided cookie rather than a pill at all - stretched into the blob the
 * selected theme option was drawn as.
 *
 * `RoundedCornerShape(percent = 50)` recomputes its radius as
 * `min(width, height) / 2` on every draw, so it is a correct capsule at any
 * size and any aspect ratio - which matters because these elements are measured
 * from their labels and change width with the text and with font scale.
 *
 * This asserts the *type*, not a rendered pixel, because a plain JVM test cannot
 * rasterise a Compose outline. That is enough to fail loudly if someone swaps a
 * capsule token back to a polygon: the shapes differ in runtime type, and the
 * polygon-backed one is exactly what this test exists to keep out.
